This is a simple WebView Wrapper for www.Rebrickable.com

For the most part this app is just a the Rebrickable mobile site with the ability to resume where you left off any time you tap the app on your home screen, rather than what the current "add to home screen" shortcut does - taking you to the home page in a new Chrome tab each time. Plus a couple of additional features I think are neat, such as the ability to use the new Beta Feed as your default home page. 

Features:
- Persistient Beta Feed via toggle in settings shade
- Share button to quickly share cool MOCs with friends
- 'Go to top' button so you don't need to scroll all the way back up to the top of the page to get to the menu
- Menu buttons color matches Rebrickable background color

To install this app you will need to enable installation of apps from unknown sources on your phone. On first install you will be asked to scan the app (go ahead and do so). On first open you will be asked to enable deep linking (open by default). Tap on the "enable" button and then click "Add links" and select both. This app will also not be added to your home screen automatically (even if you have the option enabled), so if you'd like it there you will need to add it manually. 

This app is in no way associated with Rebrickable.com or The LEGO Group and is provided for personal use only.
